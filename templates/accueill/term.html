The Smart Pharmacy service allows you to nominate one of any of &lsquo;Smart Pharmacies &rsquo;(being pharmacies that are set up to deliver this additional functionality) in your vicinity via Quick Lab. If no pharmacies have registered as &lsquo;Smart Pharmacies &rsquo;in your area then this feature will not be available unless or until this happens. Once you have nominated a Smart Pharmacy we will copy your NHS number into your account (to act as a unique identifier) and share it with your nominated pharmacy. We will then be able to provide you with notifications regarding your prescriptions (as may be provided to us by the relevant pharmacy), including details as to when it is ready for collection (or is out for delivery as appropriate).

You should address any issues with regard to the accuracy of such messages to your nominated pharmacy.

If for whatever reason your GP Practice should choose to limit certain elements of the Service within its clinical systems then this will impact on your ability to use the Service and if this should occur then it is something you should discuss this with your GP Practice directly.
                                                            <p>3.5 The Service is designed to be accessed via the Website or through our App.

We recommend that you should only print or export any data where there is a clear need for you to do so.

For security reasons this link will be valid for a period of 24 hours from the time it is created, after which it will no longer work and you would need to create a new link should you wish to do so. You are also able to deactivate any valid link within the 24 hour sharing period at any time via the same section of the Service which you used to create the link.

Please note that while you can revoke access via the share your record service at any time, while the link is live there is nothing to prevent any third party with whom you have shared the link from itself making that link available to other persons, and if they have the passcode from copying the data contained in the record or taking screenshots of the information. Given the nature of the information in your record it is your responsibility to only provide the link to trusted recipients that may need access to certain details so as to be better able to provide you with care (for example, if you were abroad then you may wish to give access to a local pharmacist to enable them to check whether you have certain allergies recorded in your record). By sharing your record, you acknowledge that this is done at your own risk.
